<!-- A class defines the structure of objects.It serves as a blueprint or template. -->
<!-- objects have properties (like a book has a title, author, and pages) -->
<!-- A method is a function that is a property of an object -->
<!-- Objects are useful for Organizing data: Instead of having separate variables for each piece of data (like carMake, carModel, etc.), you can group them together in a single object. -->
